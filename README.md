# HACS Sengled for Home Assistant

Deprecated : as https://github.com/jfarmer08/ha-sengledapi started supporting W31-N11HDL
other 2 are already supported by kylev 


__This is beta code__

This is a [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) integration to connect Sengled Wifi lights to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It fixes existing issues, and builds upon the excellent initial work by [jfarmer08](https://github.com/jfarmer08)'s [Sengled API Integration](https://github.com/jfarmer08/ha-sengledapi) and [kylev](https://github.com/kylev/)'s [Sengled NG](https://github.com/kylev/ha-sengledng).

### Tested with:
- W31-N11HDL ([Ashok Varma](https://github.com/Ashok-Varma))
- W21-N13 ([kylev](https://github.com/kylev/))
- W21-N11 ([kylev](https://github.com/kylev/))

## Configuration

1. Open Home Assistant and go to "Devices and Settings."
2. Click the "+Add Integration" button.
3. Search for "Sengled" and select it.
4. Enter your Sengled account login credentials when prompted.
